72863,10,5,Really comfortable.
72863,12,1,"Horrible management, 
more people live in the apartments without the management knowing, results in bearly any parking, vistors parking in the front in always full because the extra people living there, the same cars park in the visors section every single day.

Lighting at night is very poor,  if the visors parking in the front is full

You have to park in the Vistas parking in the back, can't see at night.
there is alot of drug dealing going on there especially at buildings 4,5, and 7.

Sometimes there are break ins,

And kids live in the area that like to break windows, the managers make you pay out of pocket for the windows."
72863,12,1,"After a 5 year lease !!!!!! There's a small hole in the bathroom door and another small hole from when we got a different couch in, which also resulted in a chip in the paint horizontal to the hole in the wall. 

We cleaned and vaccumed the apartment before we left.  Other then that, to of been there for 5 years and 2 small children,  the apartment was in GOOD shape. 

Maintenance entered our apt. without notice a few times, caught me off guard once, I was home alone in the shower one morning when I walked out to 2 men on my apt. Parking was bad usually couldnt get a spot close to your apt. After about 530 pm. 

New tenants who lived below and across were pretty loud.

They're really cheap but there's always a catch. 

I give 1 star only for the fact that I choice to live there for 5 years. 

But I'm EXTREMELY happy paying a little extra to live somewheres nicer. With staff much appreciative of me."

73555,0.5,5,I lived there and the apartments were very comfortable.
73555,1,5,"I have been living here for 2 years! Kandy Asher is the best Apartmemt manager I have ever had! She goes beyond measurements to make sure things her taken care of with maintenance! She is always very busy and over works herself to please her residence! When I had financial hardships she not only did she work with me, but she also gave out resources to help me get on track! Kandy is a genuine & very professional with this property! Pool is always clean. She also looks out for the kids when they get off the bus. Anytime my kids went to her she treated them like her own. The apartments are nice and huge! Affordable at that. Quiet & very peaceful! I highly recommend Parkwood terrace. I haven’t lived in an apartment since 2012 so when I had to go back to apartments in 2017 I was nervous, but I’m blown away with how this property takes great care is their property!!"

73555,2,5,Excellent maintenance and landlord courtesy and professionalism
73555,6,4,"I have been in my apartment since Sept 2017 and I absolutely love it! Kandi and Kim are very understanding and are actual real people with hearts!!!! I've had no issues since living here honestly, well besides the people on the opposite side that run up and down the stairs but management has addressed that issue and it hasn't been anything since. I live in building 4 and my neighbors and I are like family , they even look after my children if I have to run to the store. The apartment is so spacious and has so much room its ridiculous. I love the bedroom space and closet space. Its very rare that I hear any loud music or any children outside fighting or rough housing. ALOT of people have pets however they do clean up after them. I honestly love it, the children get along and ride the bus to and from school together and its always at least 5-6 parents on the bus stop to make sure that the children are on safe. Its not a large community which makes in so much better and you can actually get to know everyone. And if you are looking for a place without nosey neighbors this is where you need to be!!!!! 

The only negative I have is too much chlorine in the pool lol other than that its a great place to live. Unfortunately I will be moving out at the end of December (Maybe not lol) because I want to be closer to my sister.  I highly recommend this property, not just because I live here but because we have been treated like family instead of just a tenant.

If the place I am moving too (If I move) does not work out, I am coming right on back home to Parkwood Terrace Apartments!!!!"
73555,12,5,Love !!!! Love !!!! this place highly recommend leasing management is wonderful. Kid friendly park and basketball court for the kids to enjoy....
73555,12,5,"Kandy and Kim are amazing, They treat you like Family on and off the clock and I love and appreciate them for everything.  You just don't find really Good Genuine people like them in that line of work anymore.  Thanks Ladies"
70746,5,5,"I have been living here for almost 3 years.Lena the office manager always kindly and help me.She’s best.
It’s great location.I love living here."
70746,6,5,Great little hidden community to live in. Located in great location in north round rock Tx. Reasonable rates and spacious floor plans.
70746,11,1,"Don't move here, A/C during the summer breaks...does not cool at all due to them being old. ROACH infested. Racist manager and maintenance, noisy neighbors always watching what you do 24/7 then go snitch on the manager. Overpriced apartment complex for an old moldy, infested, nasty place to live. I could go on... please save your money and go somewhere else. Lastly,  having a mixed family(African American) the office doesn't like mixed people they will assume stuff that is not true and think they are criminals."
70746,12,5,We have been living here for almost 5 years. Lena the office manager and maintenance guys are always on top of everything and keeping this a comfortable place to live!
70746,12,5,"The Manager Leana is the Best! She always does her best to satisfy her residence , Management is good  every one will have their opinions, but I know that when I've had an issue it's always been taken care of , keep up the good work"
70746,12,5,"This will be my third year living in this apartments and i really like it I feel very safe here, nothing gets stolen even though i have forgotten my cars door open several times.. Lina is a great person always helps when there's anything wrong with my apartment!! And the rest of the staff are awesome too!!!"
72613,0.5,5,"I've been here a year now and i love it. Couldn't ask for a better staff and management. They fix problems when you have them and make sure everything is always going good. Only seen 2 of my neighbors EVER, its completely quiet never had any problems with people."
72613,3,1,"The people here have no morals and as sketchy as the hallways are so are the people, a drug dealer next to me not only that but my car is not safe in their garage you get threats from parking and if you have a motorcycle you ultimately get it knocked over and then stolen after I got my expensive motorcycle stolen I had asked for for termination of the lease do to not feeling safe being I cant have my own property from being stolen or damaged the gate they promised was never In operation you have people that come through and park there that dont even live there and not only that you do have sketchy people that live there in general of which I wouldn't be surprised if illegals lived in these apartments for the money go elsewhere that is nicer cleaner and is maintained and updated these people dont care about your safety or the people they put in their apartments so long as they meet their quotas snake smiles and nothing but lies"
72613,3,5,"When it comes to apartment living, nothing is more important than good staff. Sure, the property may be older and showing some wear and tear. Yes, we have had a few maintenance issues including bugs but each time staff are always quick to respond and send someone right away. This is not a house. You will hear other tenants, have pest problems, and have things break down. It's an apartment. Yes, the parking garage is horribly designed and frustrating at times but at least you don't get rained on and your vehicle is always covered and it's included in the price. If you live in an apartment, especially at the price point of this place, count your blessings if you are in a safe place, with in-unit washer and dryer, and spacious floorplans. My wife and I have had the fortune of living here for going on one year. Without a doubt, this is the best place to live for the price in the area. When you count up all the benefits and amenities provided at the current rate, nothing comes close. Last but certainly not least, Jeff is the kindest, most genuinely caring individual to have graced an apartment complex as the Assistant Manager. We would stay here for the benefit of him alone. He will go out of his way working nearly every day to ensure you are taken care of. Do not pass on this place on appearance alone. Ask a current resident like us and you will get the same answer. This is a great place to call home!"
72613,6,1,"This is not a the place to live. I have had ants infestation in 2 different apartments, a one bedroom on one side of the community and again in the 2 bedroom I have now. They never do much for them and they come back after the treatments they do. They are in every room too. Not just the kitchen. The parking garage is built cheaply and it's hard to park in. The last thing to know before the signing is the long maze like hallways never get cleaned and there is little to no insulation in this place. You hear a lot of stomping from the door above and depending on the apartment a full argument. The little insulation is noticed on heating as well. You pay a lot in heating and cooling. The freezing weather leads to pipes breaking. Its build about as cheaply as they could."

72613,12,5,I'm that sketchy guy walking around and checking your car
72613,12,1,"Dirty property, loud neighbors, terrible parking garage, overpriced for what you get, and host of other grievances. I would NOT recommend."
72613,12,1,"I dont recommend living here. If you like loud neighbors, poor maintenance, VERY out dated, crapy parking, and drug dealings in the parking lot, then this place is for you. Yes, drug dealers are always on the top floor of the parking garage. Very sketchy people walk around the cars. No gates so its easy for them to get in. VERY poor maintenance who dont even clean the hallways so you have dog poop everywhere. People are VERY loud and ding dong ditch. I have a baby and it pisses me off when they wake her up. I cant wait until our lease is up so we can get out of here. Worst place I've ever lived. DON'T live here."
72613,12,5,Jeff was great XD
72613,12,4,"Wonderful staff, maintenance has always been reliable and the price is competitive. We have lived at this location since 2009. Cons: You can hear the train running throughout the day/night. I have witnessed people not being careful and hitting the beams they parked next to."

71939,0.5,5,"The place looks amazing and the staff is friendly. The closets are giant and,get this, you can paint the walls what ever color you want! I asked why and I was answered with ""we want you to feel at home"" now that's what I'm talking about. I haven't moved in yet and I already feel at home. The people that lived there from what I seen was very plesent. Thank you Sophia for being an awsom host and can't wait to move in to a place I can call home."
71939,0.5,1,"Current resident and definitely not renewing. Maintenance is horrible and so is the plumbing. We’ve had disgusting plumbing issues for months now and nothing has been done about it. You can find much better apartments for cheaper. The people in the office are nice enough, but don’t let it fool you."
71939,1,5,"Everyone should rent at Belmont Apartments through Jillian!  Not only is this a nice apartment but, I have never rented though a better company through Jillian.  She is very knowledgeable in leasing the apartments and handles it with the most reliable and nicest way.  She is one of the nicest people I've met.  Which is also very helpful when having to work with an apartment and it's rules and regulations.  As far as the parking spaces, when we first rented here the apartments had no rule with the parking situation.  It was being taken advantage of and people were parking here whether they lived here or not.  Then they implemented the rule of if you didn't have a sticker you would be towed and that is a great expense.  Getting a sticker was a very easy thing to do and there really should not be any reason to have any problems.We were notified multiple times before the towing even began.  We got one immediately and even my children who have visited either park on the side of the road or get a temporary sticker.  Should be no reason to get towed if you followed the rules they placed, and if it happens I know that Jillian would handle it with the utmost professionalism!  Thanks for reading this and believe me this is the place to be!!  I've enjoyed it very much!!"
71939,3,2,NIL
71939,3,1,"Do NOT rent from Belmont Apartments. They are not learned in customer service practices and the new manager, Jillian, is very unprofessional and rude. Our new car we purchased was towed because we could not get a parking sticker before the office closed. When confronted about the situation, the office did not seem to care at all. This will cost us an additional $300. This is one reason of many we will not be renewing with Belmont Place. I would recommend other apartments within the area."
71939,5,5,Love this place!!!
71939,5,4,Lived here for a couple years now and I really like the place. I'd like to elaborate but in general the place is just homey and pleasant.
71939,5,4,"Have lived here for the past year (2 bdrm./1bath unit) and have been pleased with everything.  The Management staff is good to work with, the complex is lovely with so many trees, landscaping well maintained, maintenance requests few and taken care of promptly, have not seen one bug in our apt., large pets welcome, it is very quiet, VERY convenient to EVERYTHING.  We are moving to a senior retirement community in November or we would have renewed our lease.  I would recommend this property to anyone."
71939,11,5,i havent even moved in and I already love the atmosphere !!!!
71939,12,5,"I had a great stay in my apartment, loved the vaulted ceilings, balcony and fireplace. Conveniently located and Property Management and staff are great!!!!"

72884,3,5,"Love the apartment was referred by my son that lives in Madison at  Dell Ranch Ive owned and managed retail stores all my life salespeople are the key Loren Perkins  is probably one of the best leasing agents I've ran into in a long time great on follow up and she is the main reason i moved there. Pinnacle you truly have a super star in Loren, thanks exceeding my expectations.
Thanks

72884,5,5,"I lived at this apartment complex for just over 6 months and I can say its been the best experience with any complex by far. From the application process, maintenance requests, or lost keys, the staff have been extremely helpful. The towing agreement for this complex is on point and awesome when it comes to parking. Most complexes have very congested parking and lax rules on towing. I love the fact I can park close to my place at any point of the day. The staff at Regency Dell Ranch are the most top notch and professional individuals I've ever had to lease with. Lori made the application process smooth and easy. Loren has helped me many times and has always been super professional and patient. I definitely give both Lori and Loren 5 stars and can say that they have made my experience at this complex enjoyable and easy, which is really hard to find in today's market. I look forward to extending my residence at Regency in the future to come. Cheers!"
72884,7,5,I love Regency Dell Ranch Apartments I've been living here for 2 years without incident in every time I have a concern no matter what it is the manager Lauren is always willing to help me she is amazing great people skills and they give awesome parties once a year for the tenants it doesn't get much better

72884,8,4,"I will update my review, I appreciate the fact that the maintenance and the property manager of this apartment took the time to meet me at my apartment so we could specifically go over some of the issues we've had and get a course of action in place. It's important to my fiance and I that we be in the know about these things, as we can make sure the issues are being resolved. What had us frustrated the most, is that someone from the front office would confirm with us and let us know that we'd be informed every step of the way, and we just weren't. We would have had to call and personally go into the office multiple times until the issues were even addressed. As renters, that's one thing we did not appreciate, this is our place of living and the home we chose for ourselves, so for us to be brushed off on many occasions, is what had us upset. Communication was severely lacking and not something we appreciated. Like I stated earlier, we appreciate Joel showing up and getting us on a course to get things resolved for us. We love this complex and property, it is a quiet place, has great amenities, and we absolutely love our specific floor plan as it is spacious and very open and exactly what we had been looking for when searching for an apartment."

72884,12,5,I absolutely love this place.. They will totally help u and make it affordable for you to have a nice and safe environment for your family...  Please ask for Loren Weinard she is efficient and SUPER NICE..
72884,12,5,"FRESHLY  RENOVATED, WOOD BURNING- FIREPLACE AND THE STAFF IS SUPER NICE! I LOVE LIVING HERE."
72884,12,5,"Great community with great staff...Especially Loren! 

Been here almost 3 years and have always been taken care of. Anytime something breaks it is fixed quickly and the property is kept up well. The location is prime with 45 tollway / I-35 right here and all the stores you need. Check it out!"
72884,12,5,The current staff they have is the best I've ever experienced. Daniel and Loren are fantastic! The gym/pool areas are kept very clean. Maintenance is quick. Only real complaint is valet trash. I shouldn't have to pay if I don't use the service.
72884,12,5,"Just moved here in December and I recommend seeing Daniel! He took care of me the moment the apartment took us here to, even now.  Very responsive maintenance team, love the valet trash.  This place has the amenities as my old complex, just better location, affordable for the huge size, and it's gated.  They renovated their main office and I saw the new gym equipment being delivered, yet sadly I haven't had time to check out the area due to my schedule.  I love it here, I feel safe for my son and I and they are pretty friendly. I plan on staying here a while. Great experience so far!"
72884,12,5,I've lived here for over 3 1/2 yrs and recently had a great experience with Daniel from the office. He made it easy to renew my previous lease  & upgrade to a larger apt.

72884,12,2,"Easily worst apartments I have been in. Lived for nearly two years management seemed to change twice. Every time there would be a new staff member in the office unable to get consistent answers//help. With the newest batch easily being the rudest even for simple things as getting a freaking package.

Gate constantly breaking down and when coming home late no assistance to get it open unless someone happens to leave. The bugs in the apartment even with ""routine"" pest management (that we have to pay for) noisy as hell neighbors who at their worst smashed a window and had the cops called at 3 am. Drunks pounding on our door at 1am. Glad to finally of left and will never be able to recommend to any friends or family. There really was too much to complain about over the two years we were there just avoid.

Only earned an extra star because most of the maintenance crew are good guys who do good work."
72884,12,4,"6/2/17 Update: The manager reached out to me personally and listened to my concerns. Was apologetic and sincere. I really appreciate him taking the time to listen. Therefore will change to 4 stars. I have no other complaints or issues here. Very happy here. Probably will no renew but only because rent is a little too pricey for 1 bedroom and job location.

6/1/17 I have been here for approx 6 months and never had a problem with office staff. Now there is all new staff and what a change. They are RUDE -poor customer service. Not renewing lease. I am not going to pay to be rudeness."
72884,12,3,very happy with our problems getting solved professionally. good management.
72884,12,1,"i should've listened to the reviews here, but decided to go give the apartments a shot. BIG MISTAKE. i went online and picked an apartment from the floor plans they show online. filled out application, paid all fees, and thought i was all ready to go, but i was sooo wrong. the pictures of floor plans don't match the description online so i got a call saying they had no apartments like the one i picked online available because apparently i picked the wrong description (like i would know) so i asked to speak to a manager to find a resolution and was transferred to JASON, who is the most rude, condescending, offensive and unprofessional man i've ever encountered in a business. first of, he is not the manager like he claimed he was, but the assistant manager. he refused to give me the number for corporate or let me speak to anyone about my issue. i'm in the process of getting a hold of regional manager about the issue but of course i have to play detective because nobody will give me any numbers. the place is not bad looking, it's noisey because of the toll road but jason totally ruins it. there is no way i would ever be able to overlook his attitude over the ""nice"" community. thinking of having to deal with him while i reside there makes my body cringe so i canceled my application and asked for a refund (he hasn't called me till this day to let me know how or when i'll get my refund) luckily the ladies who work there were very professional and helpful trying to find a resolution and i'm thankful for that. so to anyone looking for a place to live make sure to read reviews before as apparently i'm not the first person who complains about jason. i would advice the first thing you do if you really want to look at the place is meet jason. you'll be walking out within 5 seconds. stay away from that place."

The location is great and the price for a one bedroom is very affordable given that we live in Round Rock! The staff is kind and friendly. They always have freshly brewed coffee for residents and visitors everyday. From time to time they also have cookies. Yay! The maintenance staff is one of the best. They always come to your apartment to take care of your needs whenever you need them. 

If you are thinking of living here, don't think anymore. Just move in! Chandler Creek Apartments is your future home. :-)"

71893,1,5,"I've lived here for 10 years now. My neighbor has lived here 25! Why you ask? Because these are good apartments and below market pricing. If I ever need something I get a quick response to my request. Of course I'm not someone who's trashing my place. I love the management. But then again I actually pay my rent and on time! The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because they don't have a fitness center! No matter where you live you only get out of it what you put into it! It's your home, your neighborhood... have a little pride!
  So here I am 3 years later, that means I've been here 13 years and if you know how picky I am then you'll understand that I'm here because so many things about this place are good! I took Monday off to give maintenance time to fix a couple of things in my apartment and let me tell you, the maintenance team here is very efficient. Rolando came in and fixed the couple of little things I needed fixed quickly and accurately. Upgrading to 5 stars cause I bought a treadmill (not that I use it much)!"

Guess what I get a call from a collections agency and foxfire is saying i owe them money I go to the office and am told I will get a call back for more info which never happens and when I call they have no information as to why at all. Dont do it future residents. Just to move into a new place I had to pay the agency. I didn't have enough time to dispute, my buddy is a lawyer and says I should sue. DO NOT LIVE HERE. IT'S CHEAP YES, BUT PLEASE PAY THE EXTRA MONEY, AND LIVE SOMEWHERE ELSE. I AM WARNING YOU THIS PLACE IS AWFUL. THEY REPLIED TO MY REVIEW AND IT IS LIES. RUN AWAY AS FAST AS YOU CAN.

71893,7,1,"If I could give this place a negative -1 star, I would! You can tell by their star rating that they are a unprofessional and sketchy management and terrible complex to live! I was warned about this place before moving in but instead gave them the benefit of the doubt! Longest two years of our lives! I can’t recommend this place to ANYONE unless you’re homeless! I moved out in February and in a beautiful home now! Today I got an alert on my Experian report from a collections agency for $2,100?? I was clueless to what this was for since we gave our 60 day notice and moved out by the due date! They even gave me a good referral to my new rental company! And I let them keep my $800 deposit! I was always a good quiet tenant that kept to myself and rarely complained in the 2 years I was living there! They never once contacted me for questions or concerns and certainly not any remaining balances (which were none) I’ve already filed a dispute! And I will go to the renters board and put this place on BLAST everywhere!!! Two can play dirty!!  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!! There’s better places out there!!"

71893,11,5,"We moved into a 2 bedroom in September 2016, we were waiting for a 3 bedroom to open up. The apartments are a little old but for the price it is nice. The real reason I love living here so much is the management. Alma (The property manager) is amazing. She is the nicest apartment manager I have ever met and I have lived in over 20 apartments around the country. She listens when you have a problem, she jumps into action when you need her and she cares about the residents like they are family. The grounds are always so well kept thanks to the maintenance guys. I think the main guy is Orlando? I think that is his name, he is my favorite maintenance guys. He always explains things well and gets to fixing problems quickly. There are some tenants here that make you want to pull your hair out because they just act like they do not care about pride in their home but that is a personal issue and I am sure if they were breaking any rules the management would deal with them. We are about to move into a home we had built and we will miss this place very much!"

What kind of property doesn't answer the phone. Nice way to get business! Treat prospective residents like trash, the same way your property looks!  What a dump!

Did I inconvenience you Property Manager, because you actually had to call someone back? Clean your property. I can't imagine what you're own homes look like.

72205,12,1,"Absolutely disgusting place. When we first moved in everything seemed to be alright until they started doing ""Monthly"" maintenance runs. Most times they would go in after 1 knock and didn't call out when they were in the place. Paint was literally plastered everywhere. Coax/power outlets just painted over. RATS EVERYWHERE! ROACHES EVERYWHERE! I started noticing little rat droppings after a couple of months of living there. I should have noticed something when I saw little mouse/rat holes in the stairs and in the garage. Needless to say they never went away... Oh not to mention when a pipe burst in my apartment and about 12 others, it took them 4 weeks to fix the hole in the ceiling and they still never properly fixed the issue as every time you flushed you would hear what sounded like pipes begging to burst.. Management is extremely rude and would never answer the phone. (The lady at the front was very nice). After moving out they decided to stick us with a $2200 bill. We did leave the carpet dirty but I do not believe they would need to have replaced the carpet . All I have to say is avoid moving here as they will probably want your first born after you move out."

74438,4,1,"*edit* In case anyone is wondering- this place is still a cesspool. Instead of fixing things, they take idiotic measures like hiring valet trash service that we are forced to pay for even if we don't want it, and partnering with local towing yards to earn kickbacks on having visitor cars towed unless they park in a far back lot. Water has been shut off on a weekly basis for months. Always the same worthless excuses, as if nothing ever really gets fixed. When the water is running, it takes an endless age to get any that is hot because of ""upgrades"" to our sinks, and in the showers, it randomly fluctuates between almost hot enough to scald and ice cold. Any actual updates or upgrades offered never happen. They put out cheap gifts in the office as if that indicates they care, while they literally rip off every single resident every month with their negligence. Honestly whomever owns this place should owe all of us money to find a new place, and then this whole complex should be condemned and torn down. *end edit*

I have never been so disgusted by any place I've lived, and I have never been rich. Sadly I still live here because of the ridiculous costs of moving, and my family would love to be able to leave but can't.

They charge every month for pest control but never do any unless you ask, and then they use the most ineffectual methods possible, treat only your apartment instead of the whole building, and it is worthless. I have been notified of inspections several times recently only to have no one show up the day they said they would, and I wish I could say I was surprised, but that negligence is prevalent in every aspect of this complex. They raise the rent significantly every renewal without adding any type of value to the apartment. The appliances are ancient, energy inefficient, and barely functional. The freezers do not even make ice. The water will destroy a filter in half its usual expected life; large chunks of white gunk I can only assume are lime can be found after every pot of coffee on that filter. The carpeting is matted, threadbare and installed over lumpy floors that have dips and bouncy spots (upstairs). The only work that has been done to this complex in years was replacing the cabinet doors, spray-coating the disgusting laminate counters, and badly installing fake wood vinyl in the entry, kitchen, and bathroom; those floors were not leveled either, and the ""new"" flooring is already falling apart.The windows and doors leak outrageously and of course, the windows are not double-paned. Your bills will skyrocket in this complex, and you will suffer in the heat of summer, even if your side of the building never actually has direct sun. 

The parking lot had 3 holes large enough to damage a car before they made any effort to fix them, and then they choose the cheapest, least effective method ensuring the holes will be back very soon. Parking in lots close to most buildings is severely limited and they do not bother to offer a designated space to residents or parking passes, so inconsiderate people have their visitors parking in the limited space. Residents will habitually park in the fire lanes, endangering all residents in their building, and the cars do not get towed.

I firmly believe that most or all of the good reviews of this complex are fake, written by their own employees or those employees' friends and family. I do not use a real name because I do not wish any backlash from this review to affect my family, but you notice only one of the good ones has a real name, and I actually agree with her that Tania was a kind woman. Tania no longer works here. If you have no other options, that is the only reason to move in here."

My love doesnt want to leave a review in fear of retaliation from employees, so i will. The maintenance people seems like they have no clue on how to fix anything. Example: told office ac is not working right (set thermastat at 60 degrees apt stays above 80 degrees) they sent the bald maintenance guy. He said to buy curtains...curtains. He then began to explain that ""its hot outside so it will be hot inside""...LMFAO!! Then whats the point of a thermostat lazy maintenance guy. Put in another complaint about ac a week later..yes a week later. Different guy came and said ac had no freon...smh..he put some in ac works fine now. I mean i can go on and on about maintenance there; ac, dishwasher, SHOWER!!, wall plugs..nothing works right. Shower goes from warm to scolding hot to below zero then warm again and so on. Now they shut the water off completely a couple times a month..with no solution to the problem..then some of the people that do live here(men) do that uncomfortable stare, whistle and occasionally turn their car light on to see exactly what they are staring at.

71123,1,5,Beautiful community.. Wonderful staff and very helpful maintenance. Located by a shopping center.
71123,5,4,Great location close to I35 & hi-way 45
71123,5,5,"The Hubby and I have lived at Rock Springs Duplexes for close to 5 years. We were seeking a quiet and peaceful place to reside, and Rock Springs Duplexes certainly fits the bill on both accounts. The maintenance team here is really great (especially Raul), and they're also quite responsive (like when there was a challenge with our air conditioning unit, and it was way hot). The staff at Rock Springs is nice, and we have found them to be very helpful (kudos to Jana and Beth). We love that we're only 20 minutes from fun-filled downtown Austin, and there's a Sprouts Farmers' Market store 5 minutes away which is terrific. The length of time we've resided here should speak volumes about this community. The Owner has made upgrades (made upgrades to fences, painted outside of houses, put up new roofs, etc…), and this shows that they care about the safety and appearance of their community. If you have a pet, this community is definitely pet friendly. We thoroughly enjoy the thoughtfulness in design of the interior, and I'm referring to both the open floor plan and the numerous windows for allowing in the gorgeous sunshine! The stunning brilliance of sunshine streaming in throughout the house makes the dwelling so lively and cheerful. With this open floor plan… Loved ones are happily together whether they're in the kitchen, dining or living areas. This is a pleasant, quiet yet neighborly, family-oriented, cozy and comfortable place to live. The Hubby and I have found it to be a safe environment as well. For the area and location, the monthly rent seems reasonable. Personally, my husband and I prefer no to little steps like we have here (only a couple of steps up and we’re inside the house). It's ultra convenient to have just the 1 floor, and it's even better that there's no one residing either above or beneath us. We absolutely appreciate being able to park our vehicle in our own driveway, and then we walk just a few steps to our front door. The privacy fence that we have here is superb for chillaxing out in the backyard, and this is whether you’re alone or with some company."
71123,8,4,I just moved in a couple months ago and I like it so far the neighborhood is nice and the staff is great. Jana is super friendly and helpful and really nice to talk to. Elementary school is right across the street so its very convenient.
71123,8,5,"I’ve lived here for 2 years meow, and I have no plans to leave any time soon. Great neighborhood with friendly neighbors. Elementary school nearby for an added conviene. The great open floor plans are an added plus. An they are very pet friendly...this is home for me. The Manager is awesome, caring and attentive, always looking for ways to make our community better. My only complaint is my grass , we have lawn service provided, they need to step up there game to meet the high expectations of our community."
71123,8,5,"We lived in the neighborhood for two and a half years, and during that time, most issues were normally resolved quickly or a good explanation was given when more time was required along with a work around. The neighborhood is busy due to primarily having families residing, but it is never too loud late at night. Many retail options are available within a short drive, and a convenience store is within walking distance. The only reason issue we had was the train running all day and night, but it is only a nuisance if your backyard faces the train tracks."
71123,9,4,New management cares more about the tenants than previous company. Size of duplexes and backyards are decent.
71123,9,4,The new owners and staff have made living here so much better.  They have been working very hard to spruce the place up and have done a lot of work to fix issues that the old management ignored.  I enjoy living here again.  They are always very nice and accommodating when we contact them.
71123,12,5,"The new manager Beth is very dedicated and seems to really care about her tenants. She is warm, friendly, and hard working -  I am really impressed with her! I love all of the new upgrades in the units - huge improvement!"
71123,12,5,I am a returning tenant after being out of state for three years. I contacted the office and found out they had new owners once I moved back to Round Rock I went to get more information that is when I met the new property manager Amanda. We spoke about a good hour just about my move and life LOL... I realized then that I had made a great choice in coming back to this community. Once I moved in I had an issue with the water heater and one of the rooms was flooded. Immediately Amanda and all her staff were at my duplex and didn't leave until the water heater was fixed and we had water! I was so impressed with the excellent service and not once did the maintenance staff complain that they were there until almost 10pm! I received a call the next day from Amanda just wanted to make sure all was OK! The maintenance staff were also making sure the room was dry and they came and replaced the carpet/padding! What a great team!! I would recommend this property in a heart beat!
74623,0.5,1,IF I COULD GIVE ZERO STARS I WOULD!!!! I called about apartments and Mary just hung up and I have seen a lady that works named Mary  BULLY KIDS!

74623,9,1,"Buyer Beware!

I lived there alone for over three years, paid my rent on time, and rarely had a maintenance issue.  As all leasing people are in the beginning, they were very friendly.  When I left though, they were unfair, uncommunicative, and greedy.  

Their online rent payment system is a third party company.  They tried to charge me a full months rent for my last month, even though I was only there 5 days.  I refused to pay it so Madison charged me for TEN days.  Just to get out of there I agreed.  When I finally got Madison's bill it was one day past due, so they also charged $165 late fee even though it was their fault!   

There were other shady things they did I found out after I moved.  They don't communicate with you, they just start charging fees that are very hard to fight.  

AVOID MADISON AT DELL RANCH"
74623,9,5,"When I came to Madison at Dell Ranch, I needed to move out quick of where I was. Andrea was super nice and helped us move in right away.

The office staff has always been great torwards me and the one time I thought I needed maintenance they were quick to respond. Sure there are kids playing but that's what kids do and that's not the apartments responsibility that's a parental issue. Everyone I've come across has been nice and friendly and for all that was included with the cost I can't complain. 😃 it's been a breeze, very little interaction needed, I pay my rent through the portal, my trash gets taken out when needed. I think it's all left up to interpretation if ur going to have a negative attitude ull most likely get a negative response. I'm just speaking for myself and I have to say so far it's been a great living experience versus my previous residence where i overpaid and was mistreated. The only reason I gave 4 rather than 5 stars is I do agree in wishing there was a better parking situation for visitors. Can't win em all lol peace to all 😃"

73864,8,5,"The manager Shannon made our move ridiculously easy, going above and beyond to guide us through a stressful early lease termination from our previous apartment complex because of my special needs son's health issues. 
She gave the impression that they are very accommodating to reasonable accomadation requests for special needs or disabled folks so long as you go through the correct procedures... doctor's recommendations, forms from the office, etc. which will be such as blessing as my boy has enough hurdles to deal with and having his living space be an assault on his health and sensory issues when a home is suppose to be a safe haven just is not acceptable. Throw in Round Rocks great school scores, special education reviews, close proximity to the 'North Austin Special Needs Parents' Meet Up group, walking distance to grocery, pharmacy & fast food on top of Red Hills Villas friendliness & willingness to make your stay with them pleasant and I can see us putting down our roots permanatly here.

I put all I had into trying to get a home for my kids and myself, I was on the last day at my other place and Shannon called me and I was approved! BY MYSELF I DID IT, I met the needs required, Shannon and I talked every day trying to get things to work. Not just my kids were happy but I was to open the door to our new house knowing it's a new start! I walked down to the office and let her meet my daughter and chat for a few about some things and even my daughter said "" I think me and her will get along great "" . Which is good to hear her say coming from the mess we were in. My kids are happy I am happy and we are making friends here. The place is kept up well, We noticed maintenance is very quick and handles orders and a timely manner. If your interested in this place I recommend it over some of the other properties. We came from Summer set and the office manager their is pretty sure she is better than anyone. So it was very comforting that Shannon put her time and effort into Me , my kids, and our happiness!

73864,10,1,"These apartments should really be ashamed of themselves. They APPROVED my friend for an apartment 3 weeks ago, only to tell her on the DAY OF MOVE IN that she could NOT move into the apartment because she makes too much, which she doesnt according to their income restriction list. She even offered to show them her tax return statement to prove she doesnt make the number they've calculated up and they will not take it. If she made too much, why wait until she has packed all her and her son's belongings to tell her that she cant live there when they could've told her 3 weeks ago and she could have had time to find another place. It is so sad that they can get away with things like this. So now, shes damn near homeless because someone on their end freaked up. Its just not right, and they have to know it.

When you meet the property manager she is so sweet. Then someone tried to Rob my apartment.  Shannon asks me ""DID YOU TAKE A PICTURE OF THE GUY"".?. Who has time to take a picture. I came home one day and someone had broken into my apt. I'm going to be moving very soon i just got  myself a rental home. I paid a pet fee for $400, my yorkie died so my son bought a Boxer, today I got a $ 100 fine  for having a Boxer, which was not on the list of dogs you can't have. There are so many Pit bulls on the property,which are on the do not list. I believe I'm being bullied because the know I'm moving. Please do not be fooled, Don't rent an apartment here. There was a shooting,the pool looks beautiful, but they clean it once a week, one day when I was in the pool a dead bird was in the filter. It's only open for a short time.

73864,12,1,Well I was going to consider moving here but never mind because I am not filthy nor do I want my grandson around such violence. I take pride in what I payed for so thank you guys for the reviews👍 
73864,12,1,"Where to beginning... Out of all the places I have lived this is the most insane place I have ever lived. Getting into these apartments was a complete joke, we were given a move in date and they wouldn't give us the keys because one of the office workers kept ruining our application. We read the reviews before moving in and thought the reviews were probably written by people who didn't obey the office rules and wanted to make the apartment look bad... But then we got first hand experience on how HORRIBLE these apartments are. The price is outrageous, the apartment community is dangerous, and the restrictions are outrageous. Not even two days in moving in we found German cock roaches in our kitchen. Carpets were filthy and covered in stains. The up stairs neighbors we had were elders and they watched their nephew who constantly would stomp and run morning and night. The office said they couldnt do anything because the noise was from a child, the child was not on the lease nor lived there. We got a letter stating we were going to be fined for having CHAIRS on our porch. We shut that down real fast. Now, on to the safety... There is absolutely none. Being home alone is Absolutely terrifying, you'll find yourself thinking of every possible bad situation that could happen to you and you'll plan how you would react and protect your family. We have had kids run into our apartment while my significant other was walking our dog. We have had groups of kids standing outside our door encouraging each other to break in (I was watching out the peep-hole) these kids range between SIX & SEVENTEEN. You'll find people looking through windows checking if your home or not so they can break in. You'll see tons of slashed tires and many car break ins. There was also a shooting in the complex. Not even a week after the shooting rent was jacked up. I could go on and on. Please take all these reviews SERIOUSLY, and keep your family save and consider somewhere else."
73864,12,1,"Stay away from this place at all costs! It's not safe. Go live with a loved one to get back on your feet. First of all, my family and I were put through the ringer just getting into this dirty place. After finally moving in, I really began to worry for my family's safety. There's roaches, condoms, needles and paraphernalia everywhere. People here are bound and determined to take what you have and are not afraid to walk right into your apartment in broad daylight. The police practically live here dealing with all the gun play, drugs, and violence. Its not worth worrying if I'm still going to have a family when I get home from work. After last week's shooting they jacked up the rent again. We're now paying almost 1k/month to live in ""Compton of Round Rock"". The ""office people"" seem nice enough but could care less about any situation, as long as they get their check. The repair guy does all he can and seems very respectful. If you love your family and have any self respect, stay away from this place. Its dangerous, dirty and deceptive."

73864,12,1,One all of these people r a lie the only thing that was TRUE was that you have to pay for gate that never works. The police is there almost every  night . There is a man named pawl he fixed the gate but the gate has been broken for at least five years or more.The landlord  is really  disrespectful  where alot of the people are moving as we speak .i have lived there for eleven  years and not one thing changed the one thing that did change was the violence.The violence went from ok to really bad. One time their was six police trucks  overe some argument that went bad real  quick.If you don't believe me go there for a month and you will see what I am talking about

74060,2,5,I am very pleased with Rocking Horse Ranch. I recently moved into the Brazos floorplan which is the (slightly) larger one bedroom. I love the patio. It’s huge and the storage outside is very spacious. I do wish it had a lock on it. I like how the patio door isn’t in the living room which gives me more space to work with. The w/d area in the apartment is tiny but there are shelves and I’m glad it’s behind a door. My favorite part is the spacious bathroom. Maintenance is very friendly and knowledgeable and most importantly efficient!
74060,4,5,NIL
74060,5,5,"My boyfriend and I have lived here for a few months, we absolutely love our apartment! Our air conditioner was giving us a hard time, we let the office know and the maintenance was there ASAP, very kind and fixed it right away!  Every time we’ve went into the office or needed anything the ladies in the office were very friendly and helpful! We also love that we can pay our rent online. Definitely recommend this place. 👌  "
74060,6,3,"Do not waste your time or money on this place. This has been the worst place I have lived. In the year I’ve been here, my AC has gone out twice during the summer, both times taking over 48 hours to repair. Maintenance just enters your apartment whenever they wish without warning. I’ve had wireless headphones stolen from me by maintenance, and the management did nothing to help me get them back. They threatened to tow my vehicle due to an expired registration, which is none of their business. The apartments are in poor repair. During the winter, you can hear the rodents crawling in the walls. Behind the kitchen appliances are gray, dusty and dank. It looks like the only thing they do to make the place look good is cover up the messes. Parking has also consistsntly been atrocious. The front gate is always broken, leaving the complex open at night. I’ve even witnessed a car here get robbed. 

The only good thing about this apartment is that it’s across from HEB. I would not recommend even looking at this place, unless you like any of these things listed above.

Edit: Management at the complex let me out of my lease early because of my dissatisfaction. Moving out was a quick and clean process. The headphones that were stolen from me after maintenance entered my apartment are not getting replaced because I did not have “evidence.” Bumping the review up from one star to three because of the professional way that management handled the situation. I’d still reccomend that you find a different place to lease."
74060,7,4,"I have lived here for almost 6 months now. Yes, the building and interior needs updating BUT......I love all my storage and closet space. The office personnel are friendly and hospitable.
The real only issue I have it, the tenants behind me smoke in their apartment and it goes into my apartment everyday."
74060,7,5,NIL
74060,8,1,Trust me dont do it.  Ladies in the front office are very dishonest and rude.  The ceiling collapsed in the shower.  Trash everywhere
74060,8,3,"*Update* after talking with the front office I am putting an update on this review. As many of the concerns that I had were adressed.

In my earlier review I wrote a fairly detailed negative review because of many issues and concerns that I had with the complex. Mainly regarding misinformation and the overall upkeep. 

And no the office did not threaten me at all, they simply took the time to talk with me to adress the issues we were having as well as other concerns regarding the complex.

______________________________________________

I've lived in this complex for around 2 years and I would not recommend it to someone looking for a large place. It is a fairly small place not to far from everything you need as well as the main roads you will need to use. 

Maintenance has no schedule for you and expect you to be home at all times of the day and night when there is an issue. The air conditioning does not work the best in the summer making the appartments fairly warm when you are on the top floor. 

They have some rather odd dog breed restrictions for the tenants, including bull dogs, grey hounds, as well as the usual banning of pitbulls. Though I dont agree with these restrictions they also have a ban on large breeds which is upsetting but understandable as it is a smaller complex."
74060,8,1,"My boyfriend lived here for a year and a half and I stayed with him frequently, so I saw firsthand just how useless management is. Simply put, this place tries to scam you for money. Maintenance requests for mold were never met but after he moved out, they charged an insane amount for renovations on things that he requested to be fixed multiple times, while he lived there, but NEVER WERE. Like the mold. So they expect you to live in horrible conditions, never attempt to fix it (even with multiple requests), and then charge you for their own neglect? Seriously?
Also the parking is an abomination. There are not enough spots for the number of people who live there. One night I parked on a curb (there was NO red marking or sign that said “fire lane”) and I had seen dozens of cars park there before. My car was towed the next morning and when I went in to the office, they said I should have “just known” it was a fire zone. They should really mark the curb with red paint OR put a no parking sign-that’s what literally any other fire zone has! It’s like they do not care about their tenants and just want to take their money. Management should be ashamed of themselves. Y’all are a bunch of money grubbers."
74060,8,1,"I have never written a review about anything, ever, but I've had such a bad experience with this place I felt compelled to warn others... This place will try and rob you if you leave, they will try and knit pick you and take money away from you for any and everything. I just left this complex after having continuous issues with water leaks, mold all over our apartment and serious lack of parking. After multiple attempts to resolve the issue, the management would either do nothing about it, or they would have staff show up with no scheduled appointment, when neither me nor my roommate were home, to attempt to do maintenance and couldn't because my dog was not caged. I have multiple documents of work orders with no work performed on them, and then they try to charge me to rennovate the place. It is atrocious and i know they do the same to others, my neighbor had the same issues. If i could write a negative 5 star review I would, but this will have to do. DO NOT LIVE HERE YOU WILL HIGHLY REGRET IT!"
74060,8,1,"Just go somewhere else. I have never been more disappointed than here. Very careless management. People at the office treat you like a lesser person . They only see you as money. I'd pay ten times more at a place where I could be treated like a normal human being not a lesser person and that is anywhere else but here.
You have been advised"
74060,8,1,"
By far the worst place i have ever lived in. They treat you like nothing. They only care about the money and they will try to find every single occasion to charge you for something. Won't go the extra mile to make your stay pleasant. Not flexible at all. I wish I have never applied to live there in the first place. There are a lot of other much greater places out there and this is diffently not one of them. Too bad I can't give them zero stars because I feel one star is too much for them."
74060,12,1,"I did give this place 4 stars until I tried to move out and the office wouldn't help me with reserving spots so my POD could be delivered and removed without possible damage to the cars next to the spot they were putting it in.  I asked 3 times and got ""No"" from everyone, so I had to cancel my delivery with 2 days left and scramble for another means of moving. 
Apparently they're only nice to you when it benefits them or if you're a resident. Leave or write a bad review and you get a cold shoulder.  I can't wait for my move out inspection and to see what charges they hit me with after living here 13-14 years (As the place is required to be cleaned, repainted and new carpet placed before any new tenants moved in - my paint is the same since I moved in - carpet and appliances as well)"
74060,12,4,"I recently posted a review about Rocking Horse Ranch, which i did express a few issues while living at the complex. I honestly did not expect to hear back from the management team. I was really surprised when I received a call from Cristina who seemed really concerned and was eager to address my concerns. She really went above and beyond to make sure I was taken care of. Overall all the management team turned my negative experience into a positive one by showing that they do care about their tenants. A few upsides to the complex is the size for your money. The rooms are spacious and they are constantly keeping up with the maintenance. We never had an issues with anything not being replaced or fixed in a timely manner."
74060,12,5,"I’ve lived here a month now. I love it here. I’ve had service requests handled in less than 3 days, the ladies in the front are nice and have reached out to me to make sure that my service requests were handled to my liking, the area is clean and my apartment is beautiful. My family and I are very happy here and so glad we didn’t allow the negative reviews to keep us from moving here."
74060,12,1,Done with this place.. Haven't even lived here 6 months yet and apartment conditions below standard.. bad experiences with other tenants. Office staff is pretty much worthless in regards to resolving issues. Don't with this place. Is this how apartments are now days? Service and common sense/ courtesy are apparently not stressed anymore. Done with this place and leaving when lease up and going back to house life.
74060,12,5,"My wife and I lived here for 2 years, and we have no complaints. It’s not bad for the price, and square footage. The staff was very friendly, and fixed issues quickly."
74060,12,5,NIL
74060,12,1,"This place is an absolute joke. From the catty office employees to the manager herself. They come into your apartment without leaving notes or checking with you before doing so. I've had 2 employees walk in on me half asleep without notice of them coming to do routine inspections. They've lost contract documents we signed (I know because I have my signed copies) then expect you to come in at their time and re-sign. My cabinet door has been broken for over 2 months. I've called about this, made a maintenice request AND gone in person to ask for this to be fixed only to hear they will fix it asap and this is still broken. I have gotten office calls at 1 PM on a Saturday complaining about doors being slammed, I'm not sure they know their own rules since Its broad daylight, I'm guessing they expect you to tippy toe around your place 24/7. I have been told my dog ""moves in the cage"" whatever that means, and barks during the day like I have not paid a pet fee and deposit for him, and when there are also dogs all over my building including my floor. They don't bother doing their research before targeting you with noise complaints on a pet I have paid for. So if you have a pet do not bother paying for him here because clearly theyve forgotten they're PET FRIENDLY. You know this is not a place to call home when the employees themselves say their manager doesn't know what she is doing. This place is hell on earth. Don't waste your money with these people."

74060,12,4,"Update: they called and resolved the issue with us so the rating has gone from 1 to 4 stars. Just adding the update instead of completely rewriting this review because everything said is still true, but at least they've resolved the issue with us. 

The staff lie to your face and will charge you thousands the next day. Lived here for 6 months. Ac was constantly breaking. Took them 5 months to fix it. Dishwasher stoped working that took another 2 months for them to fix. Moved out early and was told face to face with staff that we would not be breaking our lease if we continued to pay rent. Told us we had till the end of the lease to come back and clean the apartment and finalize everything. Not even two weeks later we receive a letter from them telling us the opposite and are now trying to charge us over 3000 in lease break fees. We can afford a lawyer. I don't recommend living here if you can."
74060,12,1,"One star because the staff in office was always so nice and helpful whilst I lived there.

After moving, I get a huge bill to replace things that are regular wear and tear by me living there over 2 yrs and things already damaged and over used BEFORE I MOVED IN such as carpet, sinks and back door. It was documented but I guess that was forgotten. I take responsibility for the non cleaning upon move out which would have been more than covered by my deposit and pet rent charged monthly. My move out charges were quite embellished to make things look like I just flat out lived like a slob and didn't care. A kitchen pipe burst next door and flooded some of my apt, damaged the already used carpet and they want me to pay to replace it.  I will fight it and fight it because I believe justice will be given to me, even if it's delayed. I have friends who have moved out and had this issue as well with this complex. They want to line their pockets. You pay deposits, you pay rent and you pay again after you move. Make this apartment complex your last resort. YOUR VERY LAST RESORT."
74060,12,1,"I live there twice, had fallen on hard times. I did everything in my power to be a good tenant. But living on a fixed income always was late with rent. My fault rent due on first. I get that. I was asked to move so I did, front office and maint. helped me. But then months later I saw on my credit report left apartment where abouts unknown. Lie after lie.

Save yourself the headache and rent somewhere else! Now that Cirrus Asset Management owns this place, it has quickly gone downhill!"
70589,12,1,"If i could give it a 0 I would. It is a joke! I paid on time here. Probably the cleanest one here. I made sure my apartment was clean and spotless before leaving this apartment. I shouldn't have even stayed. Veronica who'm kept harping me to write her a good review and survey to here manager. so I did out of fear they were going to screw me for my deposit. Well I spent countless days waiting for my ""already mailed check"" and it didn't come. I call they don't answer. I write 20 or more emails with no answer. As i moved to a different state it was almost impossible for me to just go to this location and ask what is going on. it is tax season. so i check my credit score.... and low and behold.... look who is trying to scam me 200 hundred more dollars? BOWMANS WALK. I do not even know what I am being charged for! If it didn't look so un-professional I would have swore more than once here. TAKE MY ADVISE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.  In the end. You are better off paying for a more expensive apartment. Not to mention they complain about the heat you use and the disposal. And i am pretty sure the maintenance man stole my beats by dre out of my apartment. By the way Veronica and the maintenance man are related.

71409,12,1,"The concrete subfloor in the apartments are cracked and broken. BADLY. My 40lb daughter would make chunks move beneath the carpet just by walking to her room. 
The carpet was supposed to be replaced prior to my move in. The mgmt that was in place when I arrived (Lauren Garcia) assured me prior to my lease being filled that ""the tenants moving have children and it will be NASTY"". 
It was NOT replaced and it was NASTY, so thanks for the head up. They did deduct $75 from my deposit for cleaning carpets. I carpet cleaned when I moved in because it smelled AND when I moved out.
The apartment was NOT CLEANED when i moved in. There was human fecal matter I had to clean off the guest bathroom door. I had to clean old spaghetti streaks off my ""new"" kitchen walls and clean old food out of the sink. I found old utensils and a NEWSPAPER from two years ago behind the drawers when I cleaned prior to moving out. They did deduct $105 from my security deposit for cleaning.
They never fixed the guest bathroom fan so there's mold - it didn't work prior to me moving in. The bathtubs are also painted (WHY??) so me cleaning them would actually start taking the paint off and it looked awful. Same with the bathroom sinks.The ceiling fan cords are on the exterior of the wall which tacky and they occupy a wall plug.
Prior to leaving I got a note stating ""Exciting changes for The Creek!"". They were renovating! Their office. Because why fix the dilapidated apartments that people pay a grand to stay in? Already got them locked in a lease so who cares? Not FPI Management and The Creek Apartments!
The cares they give don't reach out to maintenance orders either. I had my hot water spring a leak. I put in a maintenance order. A week later, when it sprung a second leak, I called to let them know they had a bigger problem (other than the fact that the closet was so muggy and humid from hot leaking water that  it discolored and damaged the wall - hello more MOLD) and I wasn't going to continue empty more buckets catching the active leaks, that they FINALLY came to fix it.
Then I get a call a month later about the leak because the first maintenance order was never closed out. So for a month they had an open work order for a water leak and no one cared.
Which is a prime example how disorganized they run their complex since I received a call from John Martinez (regional manager) about TWO weeks after I moved out - asking if I had moved. Because heaven forbid an employee go check on their own? Seriously?? Bet that four month old leak in the master closet that no one ever came to fix went absolutely rampant.
The creek near the property smells like death when it's summer, the playground behind the complex is in low income (did not know) and I stopped taking my daughter there because I was afraid of her finding used needles.
The HEB is right across the street. Awesome but dangerous. HEB's turn lane is a few hundred feet from The Creek's en
My electric bill was sky high, but when you can see light and gaps around the windows and doors that happens. The walls were patched and it was very visible were they were patched. Some walls were white, others freshly painted a dirty diaper brown - and it was already chipping and cracking in places. I'm assuming the painters didn't clean the walls prior to slapping paint on. I was charged $135 for painting and labour. Literally three spots in the bedroom from THEIR faulty paint job and I'm being charged.
It has taken me THREE WEEKS to get a manager to call me (literally they just called me) about my security deposit they STOLE to pay for repairs that weren't fixed prior to me moving in or when i went to the office to address them. I'm waiting for them to ""view my file"" to see if they should've viewed my file prior to stealing my security deposit.

STAY AWAY FROM FPI MANAGED PROPERTIES AND THE CREEK APARTMENTS.
Nasty, rundown, and they will steal your security deposit and ignore your calls.

all my issues. David is always willing to help whenever he can. You guys are awesome!

74569,9,5,"We have lived at this complex going on 3 years. Garrett and the staff are amazing, in an area that other complexes are constantly changing management, Steeplechase has felt like home since day one. The office knows me by name when I walk in, and are always incredibly friendly. The apartments are by far the biggest and most affordable that you will find for miles around. You can tell they take pride in how the complex looks, as the landscaping is beautiful and you can always see the grounds crew outdoors working away. The maintenance team is the best in the area. Even if you have a low priority maintenance issue, they can normally turn around and fix it for you within 24 hours, it's amazing. If I had to pick the worst thing about Steeplechase, it would be the parking. There just needs to be more of it towards the front of the complex, as there seems to always be many open spaces in the back lot, and the front lot is always full by sundown. There isn't really any room for them to expand,  though, so I understand. BUT, I would say if you are an able bodied person, the few extra steps is not a dealbreaker, and they have covered parking that you can rent for very cheap! I am really sad that this will probably be our last year at Steeplechase, but only because our family is growing, and we're hoping to move into a house or duplex. I wish I could take the office staff with me, to be the landlords of wherever I go!! You are in great hands with Steeplechase, I couldn't think of a better place to rent in Round Rock!"

74569,12,5,Highly recommended!!! Garrett and Megan are very welcoming and efficient with everything. We could sign a lease very fast. Our apartment is very pleasant and quiet with lots of windows and a nice balcony. Maintenance is extremely diligent and everyone is very nice. The location is perfect. We are extremely happy to be here.
74569,12,5,We lived here for two years and loved it. Office staff were always very friendly and prompt to help me with any of my questions or concerns. Lead maintenance was nice and quick to complete work orders. The front office was always very clean. Thank you Garrett & staff!
72794,0.5,2,"I used to love living here, I even signed a long term lease. However, I am regretting that decision. I submitted a service ticket almost 2 months ago and I am still waiting for it to be completed. Mold is growing under my bathroom cabinets and my bathroom is starting to smell. I'm honestly in shock over this issue, as I have lived here for four years and never had any problems before. Very disappointed. Not likely to renew my lease."

72794,5,1,"I should’ve read the comments before I moved in. The valet trash service is a joke, the office staff is very rude, my refrigerator sounds like a lawnmower, the lights outside of my apartment don’t work, half the lights in my apartment don’t work, and there’s broken glass by my apartment door. The space provided for the for my trash is super small and I’ve been told if my neighbor puts trash out that’s on the ground I’ll be charged $25 fee along with my neighbor, but why should I have to pay for something that’s not mine. The manager called me from I’m assuming her personal cell after business hours from a blocked number to give me a “warning” about the trash.... no ma’am you want to talk business you call me during business hours from you business line. There needs to be a better system in place for this stupid trash service.... I take my own trash at least 4-5 times a week but I can’t opt out of paying for the stupid valet trash service. The guy who picks up the trash is lazy anyway. If you have other options take them please make this complex your last resort."
72794,5,1,"This has to be the best apartment we could have chosen. The leasing agents are great to work with and if we have any problems that need a work order it gets done right away. I would recommend this place in a heart beat.

A year later and company's have changed and no one cares about getting service requests complete."
72794,6,1,"NEVER LIVE HERE! It is not a family friendly apartment. They consider my toddler as a pet. He is in the middle of potty training and they charged me a pet fee of $100 when I moved out because they found urine in the carpet. I HAVE NEVER OWNED A PET! They also charged me for a $50 trashcan that they stole from my front door when they were washing the concrete. Last but not least they charged me $65 for damage to the lament flooring that their maintenance team did when they attempted to fix the fridge.  I also sent the manager an email about the flooring being messed up and they were suppose to fix it which they never did. Then, I had to wait for a year for them to come out to replace my dryer (which at the end completely stopped working). Once they finally replaced it they replaced it with a dryer that squeaked so loud I never wanted to do laundry and it ate almost all our clothes. Yes, we did damaged that they charged us for and yes I admit to the ones that we did but to get charged for things that I never did is ridiculous. I remember the first year of living there was amazing. The staff was super outstanding and the maintenance was quick and got the job done right the first time. Then the last year when they were bought out was the worst year of my life to live somewhere. Never got our fridge, dryer, or floor fixed. So please take my advice and never live here!---THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CHARGING TO REPLACE CARPET AND CHARGING A PET FEE!!"
72794,6,1,Spoke to a manager in regards to my application before I filled it out. Disclosed that I had an old broken lease and she said it would be approved because she practically ran the place and I good rental history since. I paid a lot of money during the application fee and got denied. They kept my money and now I’m stuck without my money back. Dishonest management. I think it’s a blessing in disguise based on the reviews I saw on here. Need to replace your entire staff.
72794,6,1,"Stay a way from this apartment they will still your money in the end I lived there 18 months in the end they Charge me $785 for painting and carpet when I ask why they said they have to paint the apartment and they have to put new carpet for the next resident.
I left the apartment very clean still they charge me
The service very bad I wait almost 2 month to get my stove fixed 
Month to get my kitchen and closets light fix 
4 month my laundry was not working right 
Many cars they stole their tires at night ......"
72794,7,1,"The management here is awful (completely non responsive), the pool is not in a good condition its like no one does any cleaning for it. The other reviews are right, it's only the entrance area that looks nice, everything else is terrible."
72794,7,1,"I used to love this place but now I’m really disappointed in the new management. My rent bill was less than normal and I went in right away to get the issue resolved with one of the managers, Farren. Long story short, she said the bill was correct because of the lease end date coming up soon.  I turn in my check then 2 days later I get a call from the other manager, Kimberlee, saying my check is short and that I in fact did owe more money like I originally thought. She asked me to come in the next morning to discuss.  The next morning I went in to discuss and Kimberlee wasn’t even there. I brought in a new check to give to Amber who informed me that they’re going to now add on late fees because it is now after rent due date. They erred but I get fees. GREAT. I ask to speak to Farren, the manager who made this mistake but Farren refused to come out of hiding from her office because she’s “not really supposed to be here on a Saturday” Why do they have office hours on the weekend if their staff has no clue what’s going on and the managers are hiding in their offices? These girls are very unprofessional and rude.  Lots of communication is lost when management has their poorly trained staff running back and forth passing along information. Their staff makes mistakes and the residents suffer as a result.  I miss the old management company.  Really wish I hadn’t just signed the new lease a few weeks ago."
72794,7,1,"The management team here is the WORST. The manager and assistant manager are non-responsive. After multiple attempts when you DO finally get a hold of them, they are rude and dismissive. The grounds and public maintenance is not taken care of. despite putting in requests to do so. Things like broken glass on the walkways, lights out in carport areas, etc do not get addressed. Do yourself a favor and do NOT rent here. You will regret it if you do."
72794,7,1,"Resident since Aug 2017. Don't be fooled by how the apartment entrance looks, it's the only area where money and care is invested. Everywhere else, broken glass, the hallways smell terrible because of the bad trash service. The garbage compactor will randomly stop working and even when it is, it is surrounded by junk and garbage. It often smells up the surrounding area in the summer. Nobody picks up after their pets. The pool water is always murky, management doesn't keep up with the cleaning. Washers and dryers will randomly break throughout the complex, resulting in flooded apartments. The appliances are ancient, the fridge sounds like a lawnmower, the dishwasher doesn't wash dishes, and the temperature settings for the stove and oven are wonky. If you want anything done with the management team, be prepared to follow up at least 3 times and double check their work after they're done."
72794,8,1,"First, I moved into a filthy apartment with bed bugs. Lease started on a Friday but they told me I couldn’t enter till Saturday & then they forgot I had a garage so I couldn’t have that until the following week. Even then, when I had my movers ready to come in….I walked into a FILTHY apartment. I had to tell me movers to go eat (I had to pay for the 3 hour delay & food) while I cleaned my apartment ..which should have been done before. SO I went to cleaning. Washers & dryers are provided in the apartment. I took a washcloth & threw it into the washing machine but found that there was already some clothes there left from the prior resident. AND on top of the clothes was a BED BUG! So the apartment was infested prior to my move in. Nice…just real nice. So I told my movers to not bother. I couldn’t move all my stuff into my apartment with bed bugs. SO now I have paid my movers a total of 7 hours just to load up my stuff from my storage unit, onto the truck & now back to my storage unit. When I reached out to the community manager I received an apology &$25 gift card to Olive Garden. Thx…that really helped. Because now I get to pay my movers again to actually move me in. Months went by with zero follow up. FYI: typically there is follow up on every service request and every pest control issue. I asked for ..i think it was 4 treatments before the issue was resolved.  I've attached pictures of just 1 wipe on a kitchen counter. That was when I moved in. The bathroom was a hideous nightmare. I sprayed a foam cleaner on the bathtub walls & by the time the foam had settled to the bottom it was brown…zero scrubbing and it was already brown. Picture of the bottom of my feet after walking in my apartment for about 10 min. So good luck to whomever is moving into apt 310.
So from there nothing gets better. Literally 7 weeks before service requests are completed & then they are only completed because you have to put A LOT of pressure on the office. 
Several car break ins. Once came home after dark & my garage wouldn’t open. None of the garages in that section were working. I had to park in the regular parking lot…no big deal. UNTIL, my car was broken into. I notified the office & had zero follow up & 2 days later my garage was fixed. Good thing my car wasn’t parked in it. I have attached a picture of a car on blocks in the parking lot & the lame response from the manager. 
Office staff is incompetent at best. The manager does not listen to understand but listens to form a response of how great she is. We tried to discuss the many issues & she only said, “I’ve had 20+ years in the apartment industry & I’ve done great work with communities in distress”. They are rude on the phone.  
Several cars every week that have no license plate & inspection stickers. Every week I count about 10 cars that are obv either being abandoned there or someone is flipping cars & using the parking lot as their place of business/personal garage. So parking is a major issue that I see many other resident’s complain about. I mentioned this to the office and I see no difference in these cars. 

LOUD upstairs neighbors! Once resident says she has to sleep with ear plugs. 

The gym is filthy. Again, something else I mentioned to the office. Chains are broken on a lot of equipment and so therefore a lot of the equipment do not work properly. The A/C filter was caked on black. The water fountain is yellow with old hard water. Nothing is cleaned. Tv’s do not work. A/C is ALWAYS broken and office gives a thousand excuses as to why. Took 5 weeks for them to change the light bulbs. Included are pictures of what the gym really looks like compared to their site picture. 
Water! Each apartment needs water softner. I have to scrub and I mean seriously scrub the bathroom and kitchen every week because the water is so hard and gross. Have to change the water filter 30 days (which gets expensive). Have to buy a special conditioner for my hair because this water destroys it. 
I guess you can say the apartments have a good lay out. So that’s one thing."
72794,8,1,"I lived  here since August ,2017, my experience is horrible and disastrous. They gave me the dirtiest apartment on earth, they did not even clean it when they gave me the key. I was shocked when I saw it. I have to wait for more than a month for them to fix a clogged toilet. I reported a clogged toilet  almost  two weeks they just fixed it. We spent yesterday day night without a/c  ,  I was about leave that apartment to rent a hotel. Too much problems here. The good thing is my lease is about to end"

My family and I moved out of these apartments 2 months ago and we had pay a high amount of money for moving out and because they said that our apartments was dirty and had damages when they know that’s a lie. When we got there the dishwasher didn’t work, the bathroom extractor didn’t  work, and also the bathroom door handle didn’t work, we notified that to office so many times and they didn’t fix anything. We lived there for 2 years and they never checked the air conditioning filter the whole time we were living there, and they still charged us for damages, and also today my dad got a call from them saying that he owns them about $200 when he already paid a lot of money. The deserve zero star. I am not who to say “do not move to these apartments” but I will say think about it like 100 times before moving."

72794,12,1,"I have been wanting to move here for the past month. I did extensive research and read endless reviews on how the property/office management is rude, disrespectful, dishonest and lazy. I have visited friends that live in this apartment complex and still found that this is where I wanted to reside once it was time for me to move. The rent which was listed at between 1160 and 1200 was great considering their are new apartment complexes with high end amenities, stainless steel appliances, huge rooms and living areas, amazing kitchen are and breathtaking closet and restroom spaces, but of course you will be paying at least 1270 or above.Today is Friday and I was ready to come in and put my deposit down at Lodge at Warner ranch for a 2/2 for myself and my daughter. I knew I would have no worries getting approved as a hard working single mother who pays all bills and on time. To my astonishment the rent for the smaller 2/2 is starting at a whopping $1270 and it gets better... that the low end price, it gets higher. I was told to speak to Kendra, let her know I was referred by the tenants currently living there. Of course one person cant change things but OMG to pay that much I might as well go on New Meister lane and put a deposit down with the new developments there that offer so much more. Pretty sad how apartment complexes price gage like that and have reason to believe its because it's tax season and some people just take whatever because of certain situations. I''ll wait on it."

72794,12,1,"The review is for the front office. How astounding corporate has done nothing to address the complaints. The property is beautiful. The layouts of the apartments are wonderful. The things requiring maintenance inside the apartments include poorly maintained washers and dryers, garbage disposals, and the air conditioning and heating units. The MANDATORY garbage takeaway system is outrageous as they only come four days a week but it is REQUIRED for each apartment to be charged thirty dollars a month for the garbage takeaway where it is literally one or two guys that come by, grab your garbage bag, throw it IN THE TRUNK OF THEIR CAR and then drive it to the dumpster. This should never be required to pay for this type of service. Ever. The maintenance staff is wonderful as it is not their fault that communication from the abhorrent front office fail to reach them or be conveyed correctly. 
Overall  
- apartments are great
- property is beautiful 
- front office is beyond subpar and it doesn't come down to just one individual, it is the ENTIRE front office. Extremely poorly managed and ran. There are no repercussions for errors made by the staff. They are unapologetic, rude, and self righteous. 
- maintenance - wonderful and kind people, they always have a wave or smile when passing them on the property
- greystar - the parent company - clearly do not care at all about the numerous poor ratings on the front office - understand that SPEAKS VOLUMES ABOUT THEIR PRIORITIES - it is not you they consider a priority but their bottom dollar."

72889,6,1,"2 months ago, I would have given 2 stars 9 months ago I would have given 3 or 4 ....as of right now this place truly only gets 1 star from me.

My girl and I decided to go to the pool after both working all of memorial day weekend.....we knew it would be pretty packed like most weekends, however, we were NOT expecting to have to hunt for an actual seat to sit in watching car loads of people that absolutely do not live here or even KNOW anyone that live here  drive in and join their friends sitting at the tables .....cooking on the grill.....ect..

Come to find out later from my 15 year old niece that has lived in this neighborhood her entire life....that The Landing is the place EVERYONE goes too.

This place, that we pay just shy of two grand a month to live and enjoy the amneitities well, apparently is OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.

A neighbor, that also PAYS to live here had to share a seat Saturday night with another resident of the landing because the main pool area was so crammed with people that do NOT live here....

Couple that with the pest control we have been waiting a month for....the AC that craps-out every 4 weeks, the appliances installed with the wrong parts, the towel racks that just fall off the wall when you grab your towel after a shower ....in sorry .....but this place just sucks.....

And all the little complaints we have just dealet with.....but when we cannot swim or even sit at the pool we pay to use have been cut off from the pool tables and the cinema for the last few months and now the gym there is a serious problem

And NO i will NOT call the office .....I want the management to just FIX the problem....if your reading this then DO SOMETHING about it...atleast Manny would go out and ask people their apartment number ....you guys seem fine with this place being a free for all

Update: our request to have our oven fixed was completly ignored for almost an entire MONTH!! 

Our beautiful vintage oven from the 90's would decide atleast 3 to 4 days a week to just not turn on. It would take roughly an hour of wiggling, rocking it back and forth, and moving the entire thing out of its spot to move the plug around while praying to the appliance gods to grant us a connection between the electrical outlet and the oven ""one more time"" because the maintenance workers should be there to fix it the next day right? Ha! Wrong!!!! 

3 weeks after our request to fix it the poor oven had, had enough and no amount of coaxing would work (yes, our shepards pie was microwaved that night) 

So another request was put in. After 3 days of nothing a face to face consult was needed. Turned out they had seen our requests (we had 3 in their system), and on 3 separate occasions we were ignored.

It just baffles me, and now the office wants a credit card from us for packages that are delivered!!! Seriously?? We have absolutely zero control over the fact any packages that are ordered get dropped off at the office rather than the front door. The office does not notify us if we have a package however, if it is left there for more than a few days (even though they do not notify anyone its there) they are going to start charging your card on file ......like HOLY $***.....NO THANKS ....one more month baby and we are FREEEEE....

Daniel and Monica are actually working very hard to make sure that tenants follow the rules of the property so that we can use the pools and amenities without having to deal with unattended children, loud noises and music, pets off-leash, and people not picking up after said pets. We have also had major issues with people from the surrounding community trespassing on the property and using the pools, but with the new systems they are putting in place, I can only see that getting better. The maintenance manager and his team are the best that they have been since we moved in and they are dealing with hundreds of units, so I am pretty impressed with how quickly they get to major and minor issues. The only reasons that I can't go full five-star are that some of the tenants here are extremely reluctant to follow those rules and have been very rude to the staff. They want to park in fire zones, leave vehicles abandoned in much-needed spots, or won't pick up after their pets. That is not management's fault and they are truly working hard to deal with that and I am sure that it will improve with time. Another reason is the aging infrastructure. The main clubhouse is getting a remodel and that is nice. They also added a dog park and changed out some grills and the last owner revamped the pools on the clubhouse side, but the Phase II side pool has quite a few areas that need some work. It didn't get the same makeover that the clubhouse side did two years ago. The interiors of the apartments are getting upgraded as old tenants move out, so the new ones are quite lovely, but some of the cosmetic issues in the older units don't get fixed due to budget constraints. Windows with so much hard water, you can't see through them, mismatched fixtures, cracked tiles, and scratched wood flooring. I get it, it is much easier to redo an empty unit than work around a family that is occupying one, but if you are a meticulous person moving into an older unit, just be aware of those types of things. All that said, I just hope that if you are a prospective tenant, you will enjoy and take care of this community as if you owned it and if you are a current tenant, that you let the staff know how they are doing and what, if any, issues you have. As they always say, if they don't know there is a problem, they can't fix it."
72889,9,1,Lots of Scorpions in the apts be careful guy
72889,9,5,This place has the nicest staff Monica and Amanda were the biggest help when we are trying to move in and we had a couple questions about the property and everything got handled very smoothly this is a great place to live especially for the pools
72889,9,2,Not good. Rude people. 2 stars because of the location.
72889,9,1,"Based on the miserable month filled with unending headaches due to poor management wrought with terrible communication skills all I can say is DO NOT MOVE HERE. *See how they added that bull in response to my review. For those reading this review know that it is over a month later and I continue to have problems to this day. Whatever ghost that responded to the original review has never actually contacted me and now they've tried to make it my job to get into contact with them. What a joke. The ""run-around"" is the management practice of choice for the team here. This is how they function*"
72889,11,1,Management is so terrible here . This place would be great if it had the managers we use to have . Johnny is really unprofessional along with the leasing manager .
72889,11,1,"A 400.00 pet fee and extra 20.00 each month that’s not applied to damages caused by the pet, because it’s a fee and not a deposit!!!! WTF"
72889,11,5,"Great place to live!!!! I have been here 8 years.  The management team is superior! They treat you like you are family and respond to maintenance in a timely manner, (best countenance team in Austin!)  Next door to HEB , great amenities    Brand new look in the front office as they are re-doing the whole downstairs. Thanks to Amanda who is the very best!"
72889,11,1,"Lived here for about 2 years.
PROS: Very close to HEB. Well planned layouts Office building design is grand 
CONS: 
Rent: Homes available in Avery Ranch area for slightly lower rent 	Admin office: Zero customer service minded people in office. Poor at taking feedback. Rookie office staff: They tried 3-4 times to get online payment service work right. Had to run and  submit checks  b4 deadline. Never even apologized to residents or accepted that they troubled not once but 3-4 times. 
Security issue: Abandoned & wrecked vehicles with expired registrations in parking lots. More cars than parking lots. Security Issue: Gates are never closed, you can see people surveying homes at times driving around(could be visitors too). Security Issue: Parking lots have non-resident vehicles during day with people taking naps in the cars, they just can't be service guys all the time. Illegal Noise levels: Few residents have their car mufflers cut, they like going for rides at midnight  Illegal noise levels : A couple of residents leave at 4.00 am in the morning, but would like to warm up the engines from 3.45 am and wake up everyone. Services you pay for but get poor service levels:  Trash not picked regularly, spotty maintenance service, Gym . Dog Poop everywhere in common areas. High probability you might step on it alteast once a day"
72889,12,5,Like what I’m reading. Thinking of moving there .
72889,12,1,"I absolutely hated their management.
So unorganized and unfriendly. They are hard to get in contact with and have to call them"
72889,12,5,"Moved from Chicago and lived her for about 8 months, the apartments are beautiful with pools on both side of building and the amenities are well maintained. They always listen to any problem reported and were very quick & friendly with paperwork too. Love the fact that they little parties for every occasion!"
